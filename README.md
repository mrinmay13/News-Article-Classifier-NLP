News Article Classification using NLP

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that classifies news articles into multiple predefined categories such as **sports, politics, and technology** using machine learning techniques.

ðŸ“° Project Highlights:
- Collection and preprocessing of labeled news articles
- Cleaning and normalization of text (stopword removal, lemmatization, etc.)
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words, and Word Embeddings (Word2Vec/GloVe)
- Model development using Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Performance evaluation with accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrix, and category distribution analysis
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning for better generalization

ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries:
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Gensim, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project is ideal for learning how to build robust NLP classifiers for real-world text categorization tasks such as news filtering and content recommendation systems.
